# learningIPC-PyCSharp

I'm trying to teach myself how to set up [inter-process communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication) between two processes - one written in Python, the other written in C#. Basically, I'm trying to create something like [this](https://github.com/Pratheeswaran/IPC) example by Pratheeswaran Perumal.
